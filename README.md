Backend Development with Node.js & Express.js

Welcome to my backend learning journey! 👨‍💻✨  
This repository contains my practice projects and code snippets as I dive into the world of **backend development** using **Node.js** and **Express.js**. I'm following resources from **Shayrians Coding School** and documenting everything as I go.

## 📌 What’s Inside

### 📁 File System Operations (Node.js `fs` module)
Practicing essential file system tasks including:
- Creating and writing files
- Appending data to existing files
- Renaming files
- Deleting files and directories
- Copying files
- Reading directory contents
- Reading file content

Each operation is clearly documented with comments and organized inside `fileOperations.js`.

### 🌐 HTTP Server with Express.js
Built a basic server application to learn about:
- Setting up an Express server
- Defining routes like `/`, `/about`, and `/profile`
- Implementing middleware for request logging
- Handling errors with a custom error-handling middleware
- Running a server on `http://localhost:3000`

---

## 📦 How to Run

### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
````

### Run File System Scripts

Uncomment the desired operation inside `fileOperations.js` and run:

```bash
node fileSystem/fileOperations.js
```

### Run Express Server

```bash
node HTTP/server.js
```

Or install `nodemon` for automatic reloading:

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
nodemon HTTP/server.js
```
